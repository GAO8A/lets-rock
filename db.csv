It blankets large areas of limestone plain and escarpment faces and extends southwards to cover drift drumlins. Historically, it has been viewed as a late-glacial still-stand or re-advance frontal moraine ridge but sedimentological work suggests it is largely the result of intense quarrying of escarpment faces, very limited subglacial and englacial transport and passive melt-out. It reflects intense lateral and frontal plucking of drumlinized interfluves along Paleozoic escarpments and has been partially and fully reworked by subglacial meltwaters often being present in esker cores that occupy through valleys between drumlinized interfluves. Quarrying of escarpments has been the primary source of the carbonate debris that dominates tills and other glacial sediments in Southern Ontario. 

The large tract of Dummer Moraine was a major obstacle to mid-nineteenth European settlers faced with the prospect of ‘farming rocks’ on the limestone plains south of the Shield (popularly known as ‘the land in between’). It is a strangely attractive landscape of bare limestone plain, hummocks of bouldery rubble with large slabs of limestone, farms that have gone back to bush, lakes and forest with the odd small patch of glacial sediment that can be grazed. It but it comes alive in the fall when dark rock is exposed by thinning foliage and juxtaposed against red maples; a classic Ontario glacial landscape now recognized as part of the ‘hard bed’ of an ice stream.

The widely acclaimed ‘Voice of the Land’ was A. Purdy (1918-2000) who was born in Wooler just north of Trenton. Purdy wrote his most famous poem ’The Country North of Belleville’ in which he contrasted the ‘fat south’ of rich farms and deep soils with the ‘country of our defeat’ and the many hills that ‘picknicking glaciers have left strewn with centuries' rubble.’ ","n",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"n",14,"",1,NA,"sitePictures/c48a.png","sitePictures/c48b.png","sitePictures/c48c.png","sitePictures/c48d.png"

Meltwater cut scours (‘flutes’) and potholes are a common feature of the exposed limestone plains of Southern Ontario from the Bruce Peninsula in the west to Kingston. They are a common characteristic of ‘hard beds’ where recharge of meltwater into the bed was limited. They are also widely developed on Precambrian Canadian Shield rocks being particularly well-exposed among the 30,000 Islands District on the eastern coast of Georgian Bay. They are also seen most spectacularly in the Lake Erie basin on Kelleys Island, Ohio where long sinuous flutes have been cut into limestone by turbulent sediment-laden subglacial meltwaters (site W35). As such they are genetically related to eskers. Another excellent group of potholes occurs on public land at Warsaw Caves Conservation Area (site <a href=""/C46"">C46</a>).

The limestone plains of south central Ontario are crossed by shallow bedrock valleys which focussed subglacial and proglacial meltwaters. Some 20 km northwest of Kingston, 1 km north of Hiway 401 an abandoned quarry along Wilton Creek provides an excellent exposure of erosional scours cut on limestone along the floor of a bedrock valley cut into a megagrooved limestone plain of the Middle Ordovician Bobcaygeon Formation.  The former quarry consists of a series of bedrock steps reflecting alternations of limestone and shale within the Ordovician Bobcaygeon Formation. The site lies on the northern margin of a large flow set of megagrooved limestone (e.g., Site E) that extends 15 km from Hiway 401 to the northern end of Odessa Lake. A prominent megagrooved escarpment with well-defined ‘conjoined rock drumlins’ along its crest occurs immediately to the south of the quarry and indicates ice flow of the Ontario Lobe to the southwest.

Straight ‘spindle-shaped’, curved and braided flutes (erosional scallops) with sharply-defined rims occur in large numbers in conjunction with striations.

He later commanded a regiment of militia during the Rebellions of 1837 nicknamed the 'Bloody Useless.'  The easy-going Tiger Dunlop Heritage Trail commences by the CPR Station at Goderich Harbour continuing to the Menesetung Bridge built in 1907 with its marvellous view of the Maitland River.  The trail follows the abandoned rail line to the Tomb of Tiger Dunlop and is part of a larger loop trail system. The Maitland River is an exceptional example of a meandering river that has cut down deeply into glacial sediments at a time of much lowered lake levels when much of the floor of Lake Huron was dry about 8,000 years ago. This was the warmest part of the last 10,000 years. The Goderich salt mine is close by (Site <a href=""/W10"">W10</a>).","n",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"n",15,"",3,NA,"sitePictures/w45a.png","sitePictures/w45b.png","sitePictures/w45c.png","sitePictures/w45d.png"
